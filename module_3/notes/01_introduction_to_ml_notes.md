# Introduction to Machine Learning - Notes

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Data-driven**: Learns patterns from data
- **Adaptive**: Improves performance with more data
- **Automated**: Makes predictions without manual intervention

### Traditional Programming vs ML:
- **Traditional**: Input + Program → Output
- **ML**: Input + Output → Program (Model)

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning with labeled examples (input-output pairs)
- **Goal**: Predict outcomes for new, unseen data
- **Types**:
  - **Classification**: Predict categories (spam/not spam, disease/healthy)
  - **Regression**: Predict continuous values (price, temperature)

**Examples**:
- Email spam detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock price prediction
- Image recognition

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Goal**: Discover hidden structures in data
- **Types**:
  - **Clustering**: Group similar data points
  - **Association**: Find relationships between variables
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplify data while preserving information

**Examples**:
- Customer segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Data compression

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction and feedback
- **Goal**: Maximize cumulative reward over time
- **Components**:
  - **Agent**: The learner
  - **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with
  - **Actions**: What the agent can do
  - **Rewards**: Feedback from environment

**Examples**:
- Game playing (Chess, Go, video games)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Robotics
- Trading algorithms
