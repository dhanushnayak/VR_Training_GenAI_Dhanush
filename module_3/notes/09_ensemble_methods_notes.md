# Ensemble Methods - Notes

## Introduction to Ensemble Methods

### What are Ensemble Methods?
- **Definition**: Combine multiple learning algorithms to create stronger predictor
- **Principle**: "Wisdom of crowds" - many weak learners create strong learner
- **Goal**: Improve predictive performance beyond individual models
- **Types**: Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, Voting

### Why Ensemble Methods Work
- **Bias-Variance Decomposition**: Different methods address different components
- **Error Reduction**: Averaging reduces variance, boosting reduces bias
- **Robustness**: Less likely to overfit than individual complex models
- **Complementary Strengths**: Different models make different types of errors

### Key Principles
1. **Diversity**: Base learners should be different
2. **Accuracy**: Base learners should be better than random
3. **Independence**: Errors should be uncorrelated
4. **Combination**: Effective method to combine predictions

## Bagging vs. Boosting

### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

#### Concept
- **Process**: Train multiple models on different bootstrap samples
- **Combination**: Average predictions (regression) or majority vote (classification)
- **Goal**: Reduce variance of high-variance models
- **Parallelization**: Models can be trained independently

#### How Bagging Works
1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Create multiple samples with replacement
2. **Train Models**: Fit model to each bootstrap sample
3. **Combine Predictions**: Average (regression) or vote (classification)
4. **Final Prediction**: Ensemble output

#### Advantages
- **Variance Reduction**: Averaging reduces overfitting
- **Parallel Training**: Models trained independently
- **Robust**: Less sensitive to outliers
- **Simple**: Easy to implement and understand

#### Limitations
- **Bias**: Doesn't reduce bias significantly
- **Computational Cost**: Multiple models to train and store
- **Less Interpretable**: Harder to understand than single model

### Boosting

#### Concept
- **Process**: Train models sequentially, each correcting previous errors
- **Focus**: Pay more attention to misclassified examples
- **Goal**: Reduce bias of weak learners
- **Sequential**: Models must be trained in order

#### How Boosting Works
1. **Initialize Weights**: Equal weights for all training examples
2. **Train Weak Learner**: Fit model to weighted training data
3. **Update Weights**: Increase weights for misclassified examples
4. **Repeat**: Train next model on reweighted data
5. **Combine**: Weighted combination of all models

#### Advantages
- **Bias Reduction**: Can turn weak learners into strong ones
- **High Performance**: Often achieves excellent results
- **Adaptive**: Focuses on difficult examples
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Strong theoretical guarantees

#### Limitations
- **Overfitting Risk**: Can overfit if not carefully tuned
- **Sequential Training**: Cannot parallelize training
- **Sensitive to Noise**: Outliers can hurt performance
- **Computational Cost**: Requires careful tuning

## Random Forest (Bagging Example)

### Random Forest Algorithm
- **Base Learner**: Decision trees
- **Sampling**: Bootstrap sampling of training data
- **Feature Selection**: Random subset of features at each split
- **Combination**: Majority vote (classification) or average (regression)

### Key Components

#### Bootstrap Sampling
- **Process**: Sample with replacement from training data
- **Size**: Same size as original dataset
- **Effect**: Each tree sees slightly different data
- **Benefit**: Reduces correlation between trees

#### Random Feature Selection
- **Process**: At each split, consider random subset of features
- **Typical Size**: √(total features) for classification, total/3 for regression
- **Effect**: Further decorrelates trees
- **Benefit**: Reduces overfitting, handles irrelevant features

#### Voting/Averaging
- **Classification**: Each tree votes, majority wins
- **Regression**: Average of all tree predictions
- **Probability**: Average of predicted probabilities
- **Confidence**: Can measure prediction uncertainty

### Advantages of Random Forest
- **High Performance**: Often excellent out-of-the-box results
- **Robust**: Handles outliers and noise well
- **Feature Importance**: Provides feature importance scores
- **Handles Missing Values**: Can estimate missing values
- **No Overfitting**: Generally doesn't overfit with more trees
- **Parallel Training**: Trees can be trained independently

### Hyperparameters
- **n_estimators**: Number of trees (more is usually better)
- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of trees
- **min_samples_split**: Minimum samples to split node
- **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum samples in leaf
- **max_features**: Features to consider at each split
- **bootstrap**: Whether to use bootstrap sampling

## AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)

### AdaBoost Algorithm
1. **Initialize**: Equal weights for all training examples
2. **Train Weak Learner**: Fit classifier to weighted training data
3. **Calculate Error**: Weighted error rate of classifier
4. **Calculate Alpha**: Weight of classifier in final combination
5. **Update Weights**: Increase weights for misclassified examples
6. **Normalize Weights**: Ensure weights sum to 1
7. **Repeat**: Until desired number of classifiers or perfect classification

### Mathematical Details

#### Error Calculation
- **Weighted Error**: ε = Σ wᵢ × I(yᵢ ≠ hᵢ) / Σ wᵢ
- **Range**: [0, 1], where 0 is perfect, 0.5 is random

#### Alpha Calculation
- **Formula**: α = 0.5 × ln((1-ε)/ε)
- **Interpretation**: Weight of classifier in final combination
- **Property**: Higher α for more accurate classifiers

#### Weight Update
- **Correct Predictions**: wᵢ = wᵢ × exp(-α)
- **Incorrect Predictions**: wᵢ = wᵢ × exp(α)
- **Effect**: Misclassified examples get higher weights

#### Final Prediction
- **Formula**: H(x) = sign(Σ αₜ × hₜ(x))
- **Weighted Vote**: More accurate classifiers have more influence

### Advantages of AdaBoost
- **Strong Performance**: Can achieve very low training error
- **Adaptive**: Focuses on difficult examples
- **Simple**: Easy to implement
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Provable bounds on generalization error
- **Feature Selection**: Implicitly selects important features

### Limitations of AdaBoost
- **Sensitive to Noise**: Outliers can hurt performance significantly
- **Overfitting**: Can overfit with too many iterations
- **Requires Weak Learners**: Base learners must be better than random
- **Sequential**: Cannot parallelize training process
