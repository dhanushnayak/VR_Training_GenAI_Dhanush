## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib flask
```

### Running Jupyter Notebooks
```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Or use Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

### Running Python Files
```bash
# Test utility functions
python utils.py

# Run Flask web application
python flask_app.py
# Then visit http://localhost:5000

# Run data analysis example
python data_analysis_example.py
```

## üìñ Learning Path

### Beginner Level
1. Start with **01_python_basics.ipynb** to understand variables and data types
2. Learn control flow with **02_operators_control_flow.ipynb**
3. Explore data structures in **04_data_structures.ipynb**
4. Master string handling with **05_string_handling.ipynb**

### Intermediate Level
5. Work with math functions in **03_math_functions.ipynb**
6. Learn about modules and datetime in **06_datetime_modules.ipynb**
7. Understand file handling and OOP in **07_file_handling_oop.ipynb**

### Advanced Level
8. Explore regex and libraries in **08_regex_libraries.ipynb**
9. Build web applications with **09_flask_intro.ipynb**
10. Practice with real examples using the Python files
